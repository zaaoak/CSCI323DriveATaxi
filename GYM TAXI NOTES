passenger can be dropped off at wrong hotel, with a reward of -1
example:
action is DropOff, current state is (0, 4, 4, 1)
new state is (0, 4, 2, 1), reward: -1, done: False, truncated: False, info: {'prob': 1.0, 'action_mask': array([0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], dtype=int8)}

the termination doesnt happen when taxi drops off in the middle of nowhere, it stays in same state
but dropping off at wrong hotel is a "legal move" and will only incur timestep penalty reward(-1)


we set our environment for passenger to always start at 0 and end at destination 1
because dropping off at wrong hotel is allowed, we have to also include the cases of passenger being at 2,3,4 in addition to our set starting state of 0,
so that would be 25*3 = 75 more states to calculate, as the grid has 25 places for the taxi to be

however we do not include the case where passenger is at 1, because that is our destination already, and anytime a taxi drops off passenger at 1, the MDP will reach a terminal state
